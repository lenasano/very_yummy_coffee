# Very Yummy Coffee

[![style: very good analysis](https://img.shields.io/badge/style-very_good_analysis-B22C89.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/very_good_analysis)

A full-stack coffee ordering system built with Flutter and Dart Frog. The monorepo contains multiple front-end applications, a real-time backend, and shared packages that keep domain logic, API communication, and UI consistent across all apps.

## <img width="24" height="24" alt="harness_favicon" src="images/harness_favicon.png" /> Harness Feature Management & Experimentation (FME)

This version of Very Yummy Coffee includes a RPC backend microservice that evaluates Harness FME feature flags.

Flag treatment results for each user key are [propagated to the client](images/feature_flag_propagation.png). The code in the `mobile_app` demonstrates how you can evaluate FME feature flags (for granular feature releases) and send events (for experimentation).

\[TODO: Animation here.\]

To evaluate feature flags in code:

1. [Sign up to Harness for free](https://app.harness.io/auth/#/signup) and choose the Feature Management & Experimentation tile.
2. Find your [Harness FME server-side SDK API key](https://developer.harness.io/docs/feature-management-experimentation/api-keys?fme-split=fme) and take note of the associated **Environment**.
3. \[TODO: Complete steps here.\]

When the backend server and mobile app are running, you will see feature flag impressions (evaluations) showing up on the **Live tail** tab of your feature flags or of Data Hub in Harness FME.

If you have questions, reach out to us at support@split.io (the support email continues to be used by the team at Harness FME).

[Harness](https://www.harness.io/) is a modern software delivery platform.

## Applications

| App | Description | Target |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| **Mobile App** | Customer-facing ordering app | iOS / Android |
| **KDS App** | Kitchen display for order queue management | Landscape tablet |
| **POS App** | Barista point-of-sale with ordering and order history | iPad |
| **Kiosk App** | In-store self-service ordering kiosk | Landscape tablet (1366x1024) |
| **Menu Board App** | Real-time menu display with order status panel | Large display |

## Backend

The API server is built with [Dart Frog](https://dartfrog.vgv.dev) and exposes:

- **`GET /`** &mdash; Health check
- **`GET /api/rpc`** &mdash; WebSocket RPC endpoint for real-time sync

All state is held in-memory. The menu is loaded from `api/fixtures/menu.json` on startup. Clients connect via a single WebSocket and use a topic-based subscribe/unsubscribe model to receive live updates for menus, orders, and individual order tracking.

## Shared Packages

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `api_client` | HTTP and WebSocket client; exports `ApiClient`, `LiveConnection`, `WsRpcClient` |
| `very_yummy_coffee_models` | Domain models (`MenuGroup`, `MenuItem`, `Order`, etc.) and typed RPC protocol classes, serialized with `dart_mappable` |
| `feature_management_experimentation_models` | Typed RPC protocol classes, serialized with `dart_mappable`|
| `fme_repository` | Domain for FME feature management with lazy, ref-counted WebSocket subscriptions via `rxdart` |
| `menu_repository` | Menu domain with lazy, ref-counted WebSocket subscriptions via `rxdart` |
| `order_repository` | Order domain with WebSocket-synced mutations |
| `connection_repository` | WebSocket connection state management |
| `very_yummy_coffee_ui` | Design tokens (colors, spacing, radius, typography), theme, and shared widgets (`AppTopBar`, `BaseButton`, `CustomBackButton`) |

## Architecture

- **State management**: Bloc (with explicit event classes)
- **Navigation**: GoRouter with `context.go('/path')` and hardcoded path strings
- **Real-time sync**: Single WebSocket RPC connection per app, multiplexed via `WsRpcClient`
- **Serialization**: `dart_mappable` for all models
- **Linting**: `very_good_analysis` + `bloc_lint`

### WebSocket RPC Protocol

Clients communicate with the server over a single WebSocket at `/api/rpc`. The protocol supports three client message types:

- **`subscribe`** / **`unsubscribe`** &mdash; manage topic subscriptions (`menu`, `orders`, `order:<id>`)
- **`action`** &mdash; send mutations (e.g., `createOrder`, `addItemToOrder`, `submitOrder`, `startOrder`, `markOrderReady`, `completeOrder`, `cancelOrder`)

On subscribe, the server immediately sends the current state snapshot, then pushes updates whenever any client's action changes the relevant data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK `>=3.41.2`
- Dart SDK `>=3.11.0`
- [Dart Frog CLI](https://dartfrog.vgv.dev) (`dart pub global activate dart_frog_cli`)

### Running the Backend

```sh
cd api
dart_frog dev
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:8080` by default.

### Running an Application

```sh
cd applications/mobile_app   # or kds_app, pos_app, kiosk_app, menu_board_app
flutter run
```

### Running Tests

Each package has its own test suite:

```sh
cd <package_directory>
flutter test          # for Flutter packages (apps and very_yummy_coffee_ui)
dart test             # for pure Dart packages (api, api_client, models, etc.)
```

Use `flutter test` for any package that depends on Flutter (e.g. applications); `dart test` will fail with "dart:ui is not available" in those directories.

### Updating GitHub Actions

After changing any `pubspec.yaml` (adding/removing dependencies), regenerate CI workflows:

```sh
.github/update_github_actions.sh
```

Commit the resulting changes alongside the pubspec update.
